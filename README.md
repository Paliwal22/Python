# Python:  Insurance Claims Analysis 
<br>
This repository contains the code and analysis for an insurance claims data exploration and hypothesis testing case study.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis techniques, including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and hypothesis testing, using real-world insurance claims data.

## Procedure

The analysis follows these steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Integration:** Merging claims and customer data.
2.  **Data Audit and Cleaning:** Handling data type mismatches and missing values.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features like age categories and claim flags.
4.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and identifying patterns.
5.  **Hypothesis Testing:** Validating assumptions using statistical tests.
6.  **Business Implications and Conclusions:** Providing actionable insights.

## Key Libraries

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* SciPy

## Files

* `claims_data.csv`: Insurance claims data.
* `cust_data.csv`: Customer demographic data.
* `insurance_claims_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code and explanations.

## Results

This project provides insights into customer claim patterns, identifies potential areas for fraud detection, and offers recommendations for improving insurance operations.
